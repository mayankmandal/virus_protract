Abstract: 
We present a novel simulation that displays the contact trace of the spreadof anVirus Infection. This visualization presents the spread as a randomradical fashionmanner for, where each element is an independent to move randomly andvirusesand lifelines(vaccines) move greedily as soon as the distance betweenthemisunder influential region. We use real registration information for a populationofpeople at a small region to generate a general social depiction that is fedtosimulation as an agent based simulator. The simulation can be capableofimplementation in the SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) model tocontrol
how the infection spreads from number of viruses present. We present several
visualizations corresponding to different SIR parameters, and also illustratingtheeffect of vaccination(as lifelines).

DESCRIPTION OF ROOT DIRECTORY CONTENTS OF PROJECT
	index.html: The default file for initiating a website's. Appropriatelynamed, the index page serves as an index to the main page- home pageof thisproject, each of which can link to any number of other pages andsoon. Hereuse can fill the form our the keys hrough which the simulationcanbechanged and modifeid in accordance with user requirement uptocertainlimit. 
	virus.html: This is the home page is the main web page of a website. Theterm can also refer to one or more pages always shown in a webbrowserwhen the application starts the simulation up. In this case, it is alsoknownas the start page. It shows the Simualtion of the project. 
	about.html: This webpage provides information about the owner or handlerof the webpage and their contact information. 
	style.css : Main stylesheet for the whole site design i.e.virus.html. 
	extra.css: Other extra stylesheet for about.html and index.html
	jssim.js: Main javascript file for virus.html to fetch most of thefunctionalities for the simulation. 
	main.js: Javascript file for form handling of index.html page andsomeeventhandler functions. 
	Other files having extension .png and .jpg are used inside as project elementand .pdf for report viewing and downloading.

FUTURE SCOPE
SCOPE
This project has a large scope as it has the following features which helpinmaking it easy to use, understand and modify it:
The results would then can be fed into the SystemDynamics Model tosimulate the disease spread throughout the country, with the, ratherunrealistic, assumption that the agent interactions, and consequentlytransmission ratios, within this canteen are representative of thewholepopulation of the country. Nevertheless, a rough estimate canstill beobtained with this assumption.  Graphs can be based on the simulation which can providearoughestimation of the spread of virus in a region like - High , Low, Mediuminfected region

TO-DO LIST
Different new Attributes/properties can be intuced which increase thevalueand information content presented by the application. 
Some are - 
	Introduction of property “Social Distancing” having values - None, Low, Moderate and High.
	Property “Distribution” which shows the distribution of the eac element
	over the region having like - Gaussian Distribution , RandomDistribution, Grid Distribution,etc.
	Count of the Live Number of Each Elements present in the region Introduction of the new other methods which adds relation betweeentheelements and can be analyzed and calculated.
